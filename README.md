# Buying-Used-Car
This is a project to determine how to get a good deal for buying a used car. I use Linear Regression to visualize the data and better understand the relationships between the price of the car and other columns in the data set.

Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciKitLearn
